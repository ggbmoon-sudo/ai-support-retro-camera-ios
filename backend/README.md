# Cloud AI Boundary Backend Skeleton

Phase 17A adds a backend boundary for future Cloud AI work.

By default this backend runs in mock mode. Phase 17C-R1 adds a Photo Advisor internal beta path through the QweAPI OpenAI-compatible gateway, but it is disabled unless explicitly enabled with local/internal backend config and server-side secrets. It must not store uploaded images or request payloads.

Phase 17C-Prep hardens the boundary before real provider work. Phase 17C-R1 adds backend-only QweAPI gateway support for the Photo Advisor internal beta at `/v1/ai/photo-advisor`; production rollout is still out of scope.

## Run

```sh
npm test
npm start
```

The server listens on `PORT` or `8787`.

Phase 17B iOS DEBUG builds expect the local mock server at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

This is for internal boundary testing only. It is not a production provider URL.

## Local QweAPI Internal Beta Setup

Do not commit real secrets. `.env` and `.env.*` remain gitignored.

Local internal test config:

```sh
QWE_API_KEY=replace_me
QWE_BASE_URL=https://qweapi.com
QWE_PHOTO_ADVISOR_MODEL=gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview
CLOUD_AI_PROVIDER_MODE=qweInternal
ALLOW_INTERNAL_CLOUD_AI=true
```

The active base URL is `https://qweapi.com`, and the provider adapter posts to `https://qweapi.com/v1/chat/completions`. The config loader trims whitespace, requires `https`, rejects query strings / fragments, and falls back safely when the base URL is missing or unsupported.

The auth header is OpenAI-compatible:

- `Authorization: Bearer <QWE_API_KEY>`

The API key is never printed, committed, or sent to iOS.

Optional internal token:

```sh
INTERNAL_CLOUD_AI_DEBUG_TOKEN=replace_me
```

If `INTERNAL_CLOUD_AI_DEBUG_TOKEN` is set, requests must send `X-Internal-Cloud-AI-Debug-Token`.
Otherwise DEBUG iOS requests send `X-Internal-Debug-CloudAI: true`.

Firebase-friendly deployment direction:

- store `QWE_API_KEY` in Firebase Functions secrets / Google Secret Manager
- keep QweAPI base URL configurable via `QWE_BASE_URL`
- keep model name configurable via `QWE_PHOTO_ADVISOR_MODEL`
- keep `ALLOW_INTERNAL_CLOUD_AI=false` unless intentionally running an internal beta
- do not commit Firebase project IDs, service account JSON, or production secrets

## Endpoints

- `GET /health`
  - Returns mock-only service status.
- `POST /v1/ai/photo-advisor`
  - Validates the hardened request shape.
  - Requires `schemaVersion: "1.0"`, `feature: "photo_advisor"`, `mode: "post_capture"`, locale, and explicit consent.
  - Accepts only mock-safe compressed JPEG image metadata / base64 payload shape.
  - Requires metadata stripping.
  - Validates optional `selectedFilterId` against the app filter whitelist.
  - Returns a structured `CloudAIResponse`.
  - Uses mock provider by default.
  - Can use QweAPI internal provider only when explicitly enabled and internally guarded.

## Provider Boundary

Executable provider kinds:

- `mock`
- `qweInternal`
- `disabled`

There is no Firebase AI, Stability, or image-generation provider implementation. QweAPI gateway access is backend-only and internal/debug guarded. Do not add provider SDKs to iOS or provider keys to the repo.

## Validation / Safety

Phase 17C-Prep adds:

- stricter request validation
- stricter response validation
- known filter ID whitelist
- unsafe text / sensitive inference guard
- standardized fallback / unavailable response
- dev-only rate-limit, quota, and provider timeout placeholders
- valid / invalid / unsafe backend fixtures

Phase 17C-R1 adds:

- QweAPI OpenAI-compatible Photo Advisor prompt contract
- server-side provider config / secret reads
- internal debug guard / kill switch
- structured JSON parsing
- one retry for invalid JSON / invalid schema / transient provider error / timeout
- fallback response for missing key, disabled internal cloud, provider failure, invalid schema, and unsafe output

Run:

```sh
npm test
```

Developer-only text probe:

```sh
node scripts/probe-qwe-endpoint.mjs
```

The probe sends a text-only OpenAI-compatible chat completion request to `https://qweapi.com/v1/chat/completions`. It prints only sanitized status, path, auth mode, model, and latency. It does not print the API key, request body, base64 image data, or provider raw response.

Current internal verification: text-only QweAPI chat completions succeed, and the `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` OpenAI-compatible `image_url` payload returns a validated `source=cloud` Photo Advisor response through `/v1/ai/photo-advisor`.

## Photo Advisor Provider QA

Phase 17C-R2 adds a repeatable provider QA batch workflow for the internal Photo Advisor beta.

Run backend tests first:

```sh
npm test
```

Run provider QA:

```sh
npm run qa:photo-advisor
```

If this runtime does not have `npm`, run the script directly:

```sh
node scripts/run-photo-advisor-provider-qa.mjs
```

The QA script:

- loads local `.env`
- requires `CLOUD_AI_PROVIDER_MODE=qweInternal`
- requires `ALLOW_INTERNAL_CLOUD_AI=true`
- sends only internal/debug Photo Advisor requests
- runs the backend route path, including request validation, provider retry, response validation, safety validation, and fallback
- writes a sanitized report to `backend/reports/provider-qa/photo-advisor-qa-report.json`

Local image policy:

- optional local QA JPEGs go in `backend/tests/local-images/`
- `backend/tests/local-images/` is ignored except for its README
- use only non-sensitive, approved, metadata-stripped, small JPEGs
- do not commit private photos, large originals, EXIF / GPS metadata, or real user images

If no local QA images are present, the script uses a tiny built-in JPEG smoke image across `en`, `zh-Hant`, `zh-Hans`, and `yue-Hant-HK`.

The generated report is ignored and must remain metadata-only. It includes counts for cloud success, fallback, latency, schema failures, safety failures, invalid filter IDs, and manual language review flags. It must not include API keys, base64 images, raw request bodies, provider raw responses, EXIF, GPS, or face data.

## No Payload Logging

Do not log:

- raw image data
- base64 image data
- full request payloads
- provider prompts
- provider raw responses
- EXIF / GPS metadata
- face data
- identity data
- sensitive inference

Allowed operational metadata, if needed in a future phase:

- request ID
- endpoint
- mode
- schema version
- status
- latency
- coarse image size bucket
- error code
- provider kind

## Future TODO

- Add authenticated backend boundary only after explicit approval.
- Add signed upload / download planning only after export and storage policy are approved.
- Tune QweAPI internal beta latency / QA before any production rollout.
- Do not add Gemini Live, WebSocket, Camera cloud AI, Filter Generator real backend, or 改圖師 image editing in this backend phase.
- Do not commit secrets, `.env`, provider keys, Firebase config, or production storage config.
